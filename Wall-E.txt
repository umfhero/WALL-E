A Purechase ticket holding website to allow the
wealthy of the wealthy of this poor riddent planet.

This website needs to show clear, intuative and reactive responses.
Ontop of this, the webpage needs clear, simple and linked icons.
The images in the finsihed product will need to be clear, relatable 
and fixed to the reactiveness.

This is project 1 which for the first ever project we have probely ever done 
without a full tutorial or help from too many people is incredible (IMOP). 
This fille will be for issues that im aware of or items i want to learn to 
create to then carry over into the new website.

Images, arts and resources are all going to be place holders. In the project 2,
i would like to aim for something that is more cohesive, this website still feels 
a little stuck together. I really want to learn the skill of having one long page 
fully look matching together (Without it all being one colour).
